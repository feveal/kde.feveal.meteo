# kde.feveal.meteo (1.o)

This plasmoid provides weather data by Meteoblue <https://www.meteoblue.com/> through a free script on its website.
To configure the location, you need to go to the Meteoblue website and search for the desired location, and in the address bar copy the last part of the address, which consists of city_country_code, for example: madrid_Spain_3117735. You will have to click on the button that appears with a star and the dialog box will open to enter the location data obtained from the page.
Be careful not to put the slash (/) as this will display the plasmoid incorrectly.
When you save a location, you'll see a small image with the location, current temperature, and current situation. Clicking on the image expands the view, and you can see the forecast for the following days by clicking on the tabs for each day.
